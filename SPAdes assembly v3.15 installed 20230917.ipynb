It is possible to eliminate such messages by appending > /dev/null 2>&1 to the command line, but this does not make the process finish any sooner. We therefore kept these messages because they give us an assurance that the process is still running. Once installed, you can run as many assemblies as you wish and not have repeat the installation process. But if you go away for too long, colab may automatically disconnect and all your work will be lost. It's therefore important to occasionally move your mouse to let colab know you are still there, so that it will keep the connection active.\n","https://github.com/ablab/spades#downloading-spades-linux-binaries"],"metadata":{"id":"CDZmnGrrIGF7"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#2022-10-21 Steven Tang\n","#!wget http://cab.spbu.ru/files/release3.9.0/SPAdes-3.9.0-Linux.tar.gz\n","#!tar -xzf SPAdes-3.9.0-Linux.tar.gz\n","\n","#2023-09-15 Renald Legaspi\n","#Updated: Spades3.9 to 3.15 since that version no longer runs on colab because a different version of python is being implemented.\n","#Fix: No longer installs the Linux tarfile due to segment fault issue.
